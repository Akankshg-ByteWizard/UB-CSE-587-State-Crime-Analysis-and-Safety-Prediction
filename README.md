## Introduction

Crime prediction is a critical area of research with practical applications for law enforcement, policymakers, and communities. This project combines data preprocessing, machine learning, and web development to create a user-friendly tool for predicting crime rates and understanding crime trends.

## Project Components

The Crime Prediction project consists of the following components:

1. **Machine Learning Model**: A Random Forest Regressor trained on historical crime data to predict total crime rates.

2. **Web Application**: Implemented using Flask, the web application provides an interface for users to input data and receive crime rate predictions.

3. **Data Visualization**: The project includes visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts, and pie charts to help users understand crime trends and distributions.

## Usage Instructions

To use the Crime Prediction web application:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Flask application by executing `App.py`.
4. Access the application via a web browser.

Follow the instructions provided in the application to input data and receive crime rate predictions. Explore the visualizations to gain insights into crime trends.

## Feedback and Visualizations

The project provides feedback in the form of predictions and visualizations to help users address questions and problems related to crime:

- **Prediction Feedback**: Obtain predicted crime rates based on user input data.

- **Scatter Plot**: Analyze historical crime trends over the years.

- **Bar Chart**: Compare total crime rates across different states.

- **Pie Chart**: Explore the distribution of crime types.
